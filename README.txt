Simple app based on java spring, designed for helpdesk environment.
There is registration, and login mechanism with role feature.
You can perfom CRUD operation in ticket entity and also manage the users.
Application is only back-end, can be used by POSTMAN, curl command,
or by other app with GUI (API).
In app there is also send-email mechanism implemented.
This is my final project in university for back-end app lessons.
